# SysFanControl
Control system fans based on your selected sensor value. It currently only allows temperature and power sensors.

**Make sure to run as admin.**

SysFanControl relies on [OpenHardwareMonitor's library](https://github.com/openhardwaremonitor/openhardwaremonitor), so if you can't control fans using that, SysFanControl won't work either.
